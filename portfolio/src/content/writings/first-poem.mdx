I've fallen victim to young love before, I've done it many times.

It’s not my fault or theirs that hearts were crushed when souls were tied.

It's not worth it it’s not fair to have loved someone so deep

and know down in your bones that you’ll have to set them free.

I know that none of this is probably what you want to hear.

I’ve loved so many souls before but can’t do that right here?

The truth is that you’re better than the ones that came before.

I can’t tell you I love you cause I think I love you more

Building the skills required to be a software engineer feels a lot like putting together a massive jigsaw puzzle without knowing what the final picture looks like while competing against a million other people trying to put together the same puzzle. At first, you don't know what you're doing. Picking up pieces, identifying the edges, trying to make some sens of the mountain of jigsaw in front of you. Eventually, you start to put a couple pieces together and things are smooth sailing. 

Then, looking to your left and right, you see that multiple other people have started to complete chunks of the puzzle; chunks that you wish you had completed, but you don't even know what the first piece of that chunk is. You think they must be a genius for completing that slice of the puzzle, and looking back at your disconnected display of abstract art you call your puzzle, the feeling that you're losing a race sets in.

# How I Used to Think About My Career


The thought of finding a career that suited me and also payed well used to terrify me. I thought that I was doomed to end up either doing work that I didn't enjoy, contributing to a cause that I didn't support, or working for less pay than I would like.

The fact that a degree in Software Engineering unlocks such a broad spectrum of positions and opportunities, while nice on paper, also really didn't help the anxiety that I felt facing the job market. It felt like every job I applied to, even if it was an entry level position, was bound to have somebody apply that was more passionate about the seemingly niche skills that every job was asking for, somebody that had already completed that section of the puzzle.

In school, it felt like I was just learning surface-level applications of all of the skills that these jobs were asking for, and yet, school seemed to take up all the time I had to focus my efforts on developing any specific skills at a deeper level through personal projects or research.

Of course, the rise of generative AI also made me feel pretty poorly about my prospects, but recently, things have changed.



# A Shift Toward Positivity

Recently, I've been really happy with the skills that I've been able to develop as a software engineer. It not only feels like I have the relevant skills to tackle many software engineering jobs, but it feels like I have the skills to undertake large projects on my own. It feels like the near infinite sea of skills that jobs require has shrunk down considerably, and rather than being faced with skills I didn't know existed on every job application, it genuinely feels like I'm trying to find a job that's right for me.

This sudden burst of connections between isolated chunks of the jigsaw puzzle has led me to notice that the parts of the puzzle that other people had figured out were likely just the result of stumbling into a few connections that happened to reveal a lot for them and that all of the work that I've been doing lining up my edge pieces and throwing similar pieces near each other was not for nothing. By spending less time staring at the parts of the puzzle that I wanted to complete and more time trying to put little clusters of pieces together, I happened to set of a chain reaction of improvement.

I feel proud of where I am now. I have worked hard to get here. And while I'm not completely sure what direction I'm going in next, I am sure that I have the foundation, adaptability, and resilience needed to get there.

# Key Takeaway:

In order to compete as a software engineer, there is no doubt that you need to use your time wisely, work hard, and focus on developing many useful skills. But skills are nearly useless in isolation. You could know how to program in 20 different languages, solve data structures problems quickly, and know how to test programs in multiple frameworks, but none of that really matters in isolation. Skills are learned the most rapidly when you're thinking about how to apply the individual skills you've learned in tandem. It is when you're connecting ideas that are seemingly only loosely related that you start to see all the pieces in between. You start to see that all of it is software engineering and that all of it is important. And finally, you start to see the image of the puzzle coming through, allowing you to place pieces even faster than you were before.

In order to be a good software engineer, you need to be constantly asking yourself how to bridge the gap between different concepts you''re exposed to. Not only that but you need to take time to play with those ideas and really try to connect them yourself. This realization has made me exponentially more optimistic about this career than I ever was before.

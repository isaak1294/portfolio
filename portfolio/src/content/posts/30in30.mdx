title: "30 Apps in 30 Days"

For every day in July, I will be creating a fullstack app from scratch. I will be gamifying the process by speedrunning the fullstack development each day. I have created speedrun splits that cannot be skipped that will ensure I'm following best practices and enforce consistency between runs.

## Motivation:

I've recently been doing a lot of fullstack development and have aspirations of creating and shipping high-quality products in the future. I have a few ideas that I'd really like to go all-in on, but I fear that my fullstack development proficiency isn't at a point where I can do these ideas justice through the entire process. I also find myself starting new projects, forgetting the basics, and getting really frustrated at myself for having to look things up, or worse, turn to an LLM. I think that the solution to this is some high-quality practice, and I think this challenge will be a highly efficient and enjoyable way to get that practice.

## Rules:

1. No Copied Code:
	- Even if it is my own code, the motivation behind this is to get my reps in. Therefore all code in the project must be written by hand (or generated by something like create-react-app)
2. No AI Assistance:
	- If I need help or clarification on a topic, I must read documentation. Receiving help from an LLM often provides help too quickly and too specifically, as well as expanding beyond the scope of the question. For the sake of improvement, relying on LLMs is completely prohibited.
3. Alternate Web and Mobile Apps:
	- I want to improve both my web and mobile development, so I will be alternating between deploying web apps and mobile apps.

## Requirements/Splits:

Creating a fullstack app every day is a little ambiguous, so here are specific requirements that must be met in order for me to consider a product a complete fullstack app. These are also what I will be using as my splits:


#### 1. Initialization and Setup:

- Generate the project
- Initialize front and back ends
- Have a functioning development preview

**Complete if:** You can run "npm run dev" or a similar command and also start the backend server.

#### 2. Core Data Modelling:

- Decide where data will be stored
- Create an ERD
- Establish an ORM connection
- Add the schema to the code

**Complete if:** You have an ERD and a matching schema connected to an ORM

#### 3. API Endpoints (CRUD):

- Create backend API routes for CRUD functionality
- Test the routes with Postman or Insomnia

**Complete if:** All CRUD routes return correct responses with proper status codes
#### 4. Basic Frontend Integration:

- Basic page/component structure setup
- Forms/input fields to interact with backend APIs

**Complete if:** You can successfully perform CRUD operations through the UI

#### 5. Authentication:

- Implement sign up, log in, log out
- JWT/session management

**Complete if:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out


#### 6. State and Data Fetching:

- Implement global state management
- Properly fetch and cache data

**Complete if:** State is managed efficiently. No unnecessary re-renders, data fetched and cached appropriately


#### 7. UI Polish and Responsiveness:

- Add CSS
- Make the app fully responsive

**Complete if:** UI looks clean and is fully responsive


#### 8. Testing and Validation:

- Basic frontend testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Basic backend testing (Supertest)
- Basic schema validation (Zod)

**Complete if:** Core frontend and backend tests pass, validations in place and working.

#### 9. Deployment

- Deploy the app either to my website or TestFlight

**Complete if:** App is fully functional from my phone.


## Tracking Progress:

I've made a dedicated page for this process that displays all of the dates and automatically updates a timeline each time I make a push to the corresponding GitHub repo. All of the repos will be contained in the organization at github.com/30in30 in order to make it easier to fetch using the GitHub API.

## Final Thoughts:

I'm hoping that these steps will be applicable to every app that I make, but I'm sure there will be some obstacles and setbacks. I will deal with them when I get there!
